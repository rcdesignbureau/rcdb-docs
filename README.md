# <p align=center> Sphinx docs for this startup. [Link Here](https://rcdesignbureau.github.io/rcdb-docs/) </p>

If you need an offline copy, download the **PDF Documentation** artifact from the latest [actions](https://github.com/rcdesignbureau/rcdb-docs/actions) workflow run and place it in a convenient location.

Alternatively, If you'd like to build the docs from source, clone the repository, navigate into the repository's root directory, and run whichever buildscript is compatible with your operating system (```build-docs.bat``` for Windows, ```build-docs``` for Mac/Linux, and ```build-docs.ps1``` for Windows PowerShell).
<br> <br> Note: The Windows buildscripts are only compatible with Windows 10. Users of older versions of Windows will have to  manually invoke the ```make.bat``` in the ```docs``` subdirectory.
