# <p align=center> Sphinx docs for this startup. [Link Here](https://rcdesignbureau.github.io/rcdb-docs/) </p>

If you need an offline copy, for now, please download and extract [rcdb-docs.pdf]() and place it in a convenient location. Next, enter the ```rcdb-docs``` folder that was just created and open the ```index.html``` file, which should allow you to navigate the docs identically to the online version. If prompted, select your preferred web browser as the default app for ```.html``` files.

Alternatively, If you'd like to build the docs from source, clone the repository, navigate into the repository's root directory, and run whichever buildscript is compatible with your operating system (```build-docs.bat``` for Windows, ```build-docs``` for Mac/Linux, and ```build-docs.ps1``` for Windows PowerShell).
<br> <br> Note: The Windows buildscripts are only compatible with Windows 10. Users of older versions of Windows will have to  manually invoke the ```make.bat``` in the ```docs``` subdirectory.
