Step 1
^^^^^^
Get all your 3D Printed parts from `here <thingiverse.com>`_. All parts will be in the preffered print orientation once downloaded. 
FDM Printing is preffered. 

|
Step 2
^^^^^^
Process 3d printed parts accordingly: 

Support removal
Never use excessive force to remove supports. There will be some suppports required for these parts. 
`3d Print Support: How to Remove Hard Supports from 3D Prints <https://all3dp.com/2/3d-print-remove-support-hard-to-remove/>`_.

Necessary print detailing 
The only necessary print detailing should be light filing and small xacto knife work to ensure that all screws fit well. 
`How to Clean Up 3D Prints: FDM & Resin Parts <https://all3dp.com/2/cleaning-3d-prints-post-processing/>`_.

Optional print detailing. 
Excessive cosmetic detailing should not be done in/near critical parts of the prints that need to fit together or bolt onto a part of the car.
As long as the parts are fit securely and have sufficient structure to them, they are free to be detailed.

Tekno RC SCT410 (non-SL)
________________________

Step 1
^^^^^^
To mount the Webcams, start by unscrewing the M3x10 from the center hole of the shock towers from the body mounts. 
Get the two camera mounts (shown below) and press them in so that they align with the center hole of the front and rear shock towers, as shown in the image below:

.. note::
    Make sure to make the protrusions with the teeth face outward, i.e., away from the middle of the car.

Insert Image

Replace the M3x10 that was unscrewed previously; make sure to go through the 3d printed part with the head of the screw facing away from the center of the car.
The M3X10 will not ne long enough to fill the end of its threads as it once did. This is normal and will have no effect on the performance of the car. 
If the length of the screw is concerning, feel free to replace it with a screw no larger than M3X12 that shares the same thread pitch as the original M3x10.

Step 2
^^^^^^
Disassemble your two webcams as shown in `this guide <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wWCd5nmfU>`_, following it until the mount removal at the 6-minute mark. Afterward, slide the upper half of the camera mount
into the webcam, aligning it with the holes on the sides of the camera sensor, as shown in the picture below. Finally replace the screws and reassemble the camera.

|
Step 3
^^^^^^

The webcameras are secured using a single M3 screw of sufficient length and either a standard or Nylock M3 nut. 
The webcameras should be placed so that the center of the sensor aligns with the center of the car and faces forward (or rearward if on the rear of the car)

Raspberry Pi 5 Model B
______________________


Step 1
^^^^^^
With your Raspberry Pi 5 Model B out of the box, insert the provided MicroSD card into the MicroSD card slot at the rear of the device.

|
Step 2
^^^^^^
Next, plug the Raspberry Pi 5 with the MicroSD card installed into the USB-C power source you soldered into the ESC battery terminals and make sure that there are only solid red and blinking green lights appearing, with the green light
stopping blinking after about 35-40 seconds.

.. note::
    If the green light is blinking rapidly, turning off, and repeating this cycle consistently after approximately 45 seconds have passed, that means that the power delivery is having issues. If this is the case, immediately cut power to the Raspberry Pi 5 and cease any further progress to prevent damage to your hardware. Contact us immediately afterward for assistance.
|
Step 3
^^^^^^
After making sure your Raspberry Pi 5 is not defective, screw the Raspberry Pi 5 into the case you fastened to the car in the hardware portion of the guide, making sure to thread the screw through the top of the case, the Raspberry Pi 5, and then the bottom of the case, in that particular order.

.. note::
    See image below for further details.

|
Step 4
^^^^^^
Now, attach the ESC and servo signal wires you spliced earlier to the Raspberry Pi 5's GPIO pins, as shown:

|
Step 5
^^^^^^
Finally, attach the USB webcams to the two USB 3.0 (blue) ports on the board. If you haven't already, make sure that the power is also connected and that the plugs do not have excessive play.

.. note::
    See image below for further details.

Radxa ROCK 5B
_____________

Step 1
^^^^^^
First, after having un-boxed your ROCK 5B, plug in the compatible eMMC cartridge bundled with the kit.

.. note::
    The eMMC cartridge port on the ROCK 5B has one side which is slightly shorter than the other. Make sure to align the cartridge with the board so that the white corner triangle is visible, as shown in the image.

|
Step 2
^^^^^^
Next, plug the ROCK 5B with the eMMC cartridge installed into the USB-C power source you soldered into the ESC battery terminals, and make sure that there are only solid green and blinking blue lights appearing, with the blue light
stopping blinking after about 35-40 seconds.

.. note::
    If the blue light is blinking rapidly, turning off, and repeating this cycle consistently after approximately 45 seconds have passed, that means that the power delivery is having issues. If this is the case, immediately cut power to the ROCK 5B and cease any further progress to prevent damage to your hardware. Contact us immediately afterward for assistance.

Step 3
^^^^^^
After making sure your ROCK 5B is not defective, screw the ROCK 5B into the case you fastened to the car in the hardware portion of the guide, making sure to thread the screw through the top of the case, the ROCK 5B, and then the bottom of the case, in that particular order.
